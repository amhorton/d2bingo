# feature ideas

## objectives

- categorize objectives and allow filtering when generating cards (i.e., no crucible objectives, only three person objectives, even difficulty categorization)

## usability

- add faq and rules sections to site

## alternate rules

### vault key rule

prime engrams act as vault keys, allow one piece of gear to be pulled from collections/your vault

### exotic quest rule

repeatable exotic quest objectives award the corresponding exotic (if you complete a divinity run, you get to pull your divinity out)
