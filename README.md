# Destiny 2 Bingo

a thing to do possibly until witch queen

## what is this?

inspired by fun stuff like ocarina of time bingo, destiny 2 bingo gives you some random objectives to complete, and puts them on a bingo card. the goal is to get a full row, column, or diagonal. play on your own or with/against friends, got for majority or all-kill, sky's the limit.

## how do i play?

the main special rule that this bingo is built on is that you start each card with all blue gear, and can only equip gear that you find during the card. this includes random drops and quest rewards. for the ~ purest ~ experience, start right after the reset.

after that, just start completing objectives! can be done solo, as a team of any size, or in 6v6 teams.

### what if i want to play in some other way?

go ahead! have fun, be yourself :)

## i have an idea for a new objective, or another improvement
